# YelpCamp

This is the final project from Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp course. It contains use of express, npm, ejs, mongoDB and everything else used throughout the course.

Things I would plan on adding to the project: Dark mode, Make it so only dots visible on map show up on campground list, Infinite scroll, Proper timestamps on new campgrounds
